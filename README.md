# Dudeism-quote-generator

What if I collect all the quotes I like and dump em in one place? I mean, that's just like my opinion man.

Your roll. [insert link here]

Enhancements(note to self):
1. Setup a Dudeist theme/background/font/imagery.
2. Add more quotes. As many as you can.
3. Make the button fun!

Things I learnt while building this:

1. Using arrays
2. Using functions
3. adding eventListeners

Further ideas: 
1. Build a simple dudeist game and share it in Dudeist communities.
2. Gather game ideas.
